My crude approach to creating a Trump Voice Assistant solo in 18 hours ðŸ’€. 
Current files are messy and code is unstructured. Will be fixed once my laptop gets repaired. (Sorry, I did this project on a borrowed laptop... I'm also not a software girlie)

Way it works:
1. Whisper transcribes audio input from user
2. Transcribed speech is sent to ChatGPT's API to form Trump's text response.
3. Selenium opens the website ElonTalks.com and adds Trump's text response to the website.
4. Website processes the response and outputs a AI generated video of Trump with that response.

Dependencies:
- Whisper
- ChatGPT 3.5 API
- Selenium
  and more... (work in progress)
